# RFC Process

To propose significant changes or enhancements to ChattyCommander, use the Request for Comments (RFC) process. RFCs help the community discuss ideas before development begins.

## Steps

1. **Open an RFC issue**  
   Create a new issue using the [RFC issue template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rfc.md). Provide a clear summary, motivation, detailed proposal and alternative approaches.
2. **Discuss**  
   Collaborate in the issue comments. Maintain the conversation in public so others can review and contribute feedback.
3. **Decision**  
   When consensus is reached, a maintainer will mark the RFC as accepted or rejected. Accepted RFCs are linked from related pull requests.
4. **Implementation**  
   Develop changes in one or more pull requests referencing the RFC issue. Close the RFC issue once the implementation is merged.

Small bug fixes and documentation updates usually do not require an RFC. Use common sense and ask in the issue if unsure.
