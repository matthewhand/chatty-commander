## Screenshot Guidelines

When adding actual screenshots:

1. **Resolution**: Use consistent resolution (1920x1080 recommended)
2. **Format**: PNG format for crisp UI elements
3. **Content**: Show realistic but non-sensitive configuration data
4. **Annotations**: Consider adding callouts or highlights for key features
5. **Consistency**: Use consistent UI theme and styling across screenshots

## Implementation Status

As features are implemented, replace these placeholders with actual screenshots showing:

- Real UI components and interactions
- Actual configuration options and settings
- Live demonstrations of functionality
- Before/after states for configuration changes
