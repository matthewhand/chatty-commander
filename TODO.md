## Architecture Clarification

### What We Want (Correct Architecture)
```
Python Backend (main.py)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLI Mode (default)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GUI Mode (--gui flag)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Web Mode (--web flag) ‚Üí serves React frontend + API
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FastAPI server
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WebSocket for real-time updates
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Optional authentication (--no-auth for local dev)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Static file serving for React build
```

### What We Accidentally Created (Mess to Clean Up)
```
webui/backend/ (TypeScript/Node.js) ‚Üê DELETE THIS
webui/frontend/ (React) ‚Üê Keep but fix to connect to Python
```
