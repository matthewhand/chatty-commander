# ChattyCommander TODO List

## üéØ URGENT CLEANUP & FIXES (Priority 1)

### Backend Web Mode Implementation
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Add `--web` flag to main.py to start FastAPI server
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Remove unnecessary TypeScript backend mess in webui/backend/
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Implement `--no-auth` flag for local development (insecure but convenient)
- [x] Integrate existing FastAPI endpoints into main Python application
- [x] Add WebSocket support for real-time communication
- [x] **NEW**: Ensure API publishes OpenAPI/Swagger specification at `/docs` and `/openapi.json` endpoints for easier consumption
  - Owner: core
  - Target: 2025-08-09
  - Notes: Implemented create_app(no_auth), TestClient coverage for /docs and /openapi.json
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Running `python main.py --web` serves Swagger UI at GET /docs (200 OK)
    - GET /openapi.json returns JSON schema with core endpoints (200 OK; application/json)
    - CORS allows GET from http://localhost:3000 during dev (no-auth mode)
    - Pytest asserts both endpoints 200 and schema has "paths"
  - Validation:
    - tests/test_openapi_endpoints.py added and passing (156 tests total)
    - README pending update to mention endpoints

### CLI Enhancement & User Experience
- [ ] **HIGH**: Add comprehensive `--help` with detailed argument descriptions
  - Owner: cli
  - Target: 2025-08-16
  - Acceptance criteria: `python main.py --help` lists web/gui/config/shell flags with usage examples; test asserts presence
- [ ] **HIGH**: Implement interactive shell mode when no arguments provided
  - Owner: cli
  - Target: 2025-08-16
  - Acceptance criteria: running with no args shows shell prompt; minimal REPL cycle test passes
- [ ] **HIGH**: Add tab completion for parameters in interactive mode
  - Owner: cli
  - Target: 2025-08-23
  - Acceptance criteria: completion for built-ins and configured actions; test for completer output
- [x] Add argument validation with helpful error messages
- [x] Create CLI configuration wizard

### Frontend Integration
- [ ] Fix React frontend to connect to Python backend on correct port
  - Owner: webui
  - Target: 2025-08-23
  - Acceptance criteria: base URL/env for API/WS points to Python backend; e2e test succeeds
- [ ] Remove proxy configuration pointing to non-existent TypeScript backend
  - Owner: webui
  - Target: 2025-08-23
  - Acceptance criteria: package.json has no proxy to Node backend; local dev uses Python port
- [ ] Implement no-auth mode in frontend for development
  - Owner: webui
  - Target: 2025-08-23
  - Acceptance criteria: toggle respects backend no-auth; happy path login bypassed in dev
- [ ] Test WebUI with actual Python backend - **WORKING!** üéâ
  - Owner: webui
  - Target: 2025-08-30
