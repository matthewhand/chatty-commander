# ChattyCommander TODO List

## üéØ URGENT CLEANUP & FIXES (Priority 1)

### Backend Web Mode Implementation
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Add `--web` flag to main.py to start FastAPI server
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Remove unnecessary TypeScript backend mess in webui/backend/
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Implement `--no-auth` flag for local development (insecure but convenient)
- [x] Integrate existing FastAPI endpoints into main Python application
- [x] Add WebSocket support for real-time communication
- [ ] **NEW**: Ensure API publishes OpenAPI/Swagger specification at `/docs` and `/openapi.json` endpoints for easier consumption
  - Issue: Expose and validate OpenAPI/Swagger
    - Acceptance criteria:
      - Running `python main.py --web` serves Swagger UI at GET /docs (200 OK)
      - GET /openapi.json returns JSON schema with at least core endpoints defined (200 OK; content-type application/json)
      - CORS allows GET from http://localhost:3000 during dev (no-auth mode)
      - Add pytest that asserts both endpoints respond 200 and schema has "paths"
    - Tasks:
      - Verify FastAPI app includes `get_openapi` or FastAPI default docs enabled
      - Ensure docs/openapi.json matches served schema or update generation process
      - Add tests: tests/test_web_mode_unit.py or new tests/test_openapi_endpoints.py
      - Update README.md with "API docs available at /docs and /openapi.json"

### CLI Enhancement & User Experience
- [ ] **HIGH**: Add comprehensive `--help` with detailed argument descriptions
- [ ] **HIGH**: Implement interactive shell mode when no arguments provided

## Architecture Clarification

### What We Want (Correct Architecture)
```
Python Backend (main.py)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLI Mode (default)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GUI Mode (--gui flag)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Web Mode (--web flag) ‚Üí serves React frontend + API
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FastAPI server
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WebSocket for real-time updates
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Optional authentication (--no-auth for local dev)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Static file serving for React build
```

### What We Accidentally Created (Mess to Clean Up)
```
webui/backend/ (TypeScript/Node.js) ‚Üê DELETE THIS
webui/frontend/ (React) ‚Üê Keep but fix to connect to Python
```
