**Chatty Commander** is not just another voice assistant. It's a powerful, local-first framework for creating personalized AI agents that control your computer. With a low-resource, always-on wake word, it gives you hands-free command over your digital environment, from launching applications and running scripts to orchestrating complex, multi-step workflows.

Built on a modular, interface-driven architecture, every component‚Äîfrom the AI model to the user interface‚Äîis swappable. Run it as a lightweight command-line tool, or enable the optional 3D avatar for a full virtual companion experience.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **üó£Ô∏è Voice-Activated Command & Control:** Uses a low-compute, offline wake word engine (`openwakeword`) for instant, private activation.
*   **üß† Swappable AI Brains:** Defaults to local models via **Ollama** (including `gpt-oss:20b`), with a fallback to `transformers`. Easily extendable to any OpenAI-compatible API.
*   **üé≠ Dynamic Personas:** Leverage the `openai-agents` library to create distinct AI personalities, each with its own voice, avatar, and command set. Switch between a helpful assistant, a sci-fi captain, or a code-savvy developer on the fly.
*   **üíª Deep Desktop Integration:** Execute shell commands, manage files, control applications, and trigger complex workflows with natural language.
*   **üîå Radically Extensible Plugin System:** The entire system is built on dependency injection. Add new commands, services, or even entire user interfaces as plugins without touching the core code.
*   **üé≠ Optional 3D Avatar:** Enable a real-time, lip-synced 3D avatar in a transparent desktop window for a visually engaging experience. (Powered by a simple WebUI frontend).
*   **üåê Multi-Platform Bridge:** An external Node.js bridge allows Chatty Commander to integrate with messaging platforms like Discord and Slack, acting as a centralized "brain" for your bots.
*   **üîí Private by Default:** All core operations, including wake word and local LLM inference, run entirely offline. Cloud connections are explicit and opt-in.

## üöÄ Quickstart

Get Chatty Commander up and running in minutes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.11+
*   [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (for fast dependency management)
*   (Optional) [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) running locally for AI commands.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/matthewhand/chatty-commander.git
    cd chatty-commander
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv venv
    uv sync
    ```

### Running Chatty Commander

Activate the environment first: `source .venv/bin/activate`

*   **Interactive Shell Mode (Default):**
    ```bash
    uv run python -m src.chatty_commander.main
    ```

*   **Web API Mode (for Frontend/Bridge):**
    ```bash
    uv run python -m src.chatty_commander.main --web --no-auth
    # API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000
    # OpenAPI docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
    ```

*   **GUI System Tray Mode:**
    ```bash
    uv run python -m src.chatty_commander.main --gui
    ```

*   **Execute a Single Command:**
    ```bash
    uv run python -m src.chatty_commander.main exec your_command_name
    ```

## Architecture Overview

Chatty Commander is built on a decoupled, modular architecture designed for maximum flexibility.

</p>

*   **Core Service (Python/FastAPI):** Manages state, orchestrates plugins, and serves the web API.
*   **Plugin System:** Uses dependency injection to register commands, wake word engines, STT/TTS providers, and more.
*   **Model Orchestrator:** Intelligently routes LLM requests to the best available provider (local Ollama, Transformers, or remote APIs).
*   **Frontend (React/WebUI):** A simple, optional frontend served by the Python backend for settings and the 3D avatar.
